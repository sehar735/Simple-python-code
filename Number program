Simple number program to find out that your entered number is in list or not
The first thing I'd suggest is to check out for indentation.. 
while True:
 list = [1,2,5,6,9,10,3,4,0]
 user_enter = int(input("Enter any number from (0 to 15): \n"))
 if user_enter in  list:
   print("Number is in list\n",list)
 elif user_enter not in list:
   print("Number not in list")
 z=int(input("Enter again:\n"))
 
 if z in list:
   print("Number is in list\n",list)
 else:
   print("Number not in list")
